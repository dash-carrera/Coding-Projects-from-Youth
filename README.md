# Coding-Projects-from-Youth

These are some coding projects I did very early in college!

We've got 4 up:

1. Moon Project: An Arduino project that programmatically generates a picture of the current moon phase and prints it on a receipt printer.
2. HighFrequencyStealing: A high speed reaction game where the loser makes a serious of small rapid Venmo transfers to the loser.
3. Light Waterfall: A large installation art piece in which a person swipes a student ID card and a unique RGB LED pattern is generated for them.
4. Waves: A project I did for the Lux Light Festival in Wellington New Zealand where I simulated the movement of waves based Wellington's tidal data for a large scale installation piece.

Much of this code could use some cleaning, but is up for all to see anyway.
